## What

Drops is a lightweight Windows screensaver designed to be visually pleasing and compatible with a wide range of Windows versions.


## Why

1. On Windows PCs, screensavers are one of the few areas where users can implement custom code and visuals.
2. To learn about the Windows API and explore the inner workings of screensavers.
3. Windows XP was the first version fully based on the WinNT architecture, eliminating dependence on MS-DOS.
